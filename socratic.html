            PROBLEM
        </div>

        <div class="body-paragraph">
            During Fall 2017 I took <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/CS160/">CS160 (User Interface Design and Development)</a> taught by <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/johntang/">John Tang</a> where we explored the theme of <span class="bolder">“Bursting Echo Chambers in Social Media”</span>. We were tasked with designing a webapp to address this topic, following a human-centered process.

            THE TEAM
        </div>

        <div class="body-paragraph">
            Our team of four consisted of two developers (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/genjinoguchi/">Genji</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gemmaguo/">Gemma</a>), a designer (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/takara-s-a0805bba/">Takara</a>), and me (a bit of both!). Takara and I spearheaded the design aspect of the project, from interviewing people to wireframing and visual aesthetics. When it came to prototyping with code, Genji and Gemma worked on the backend while I worked on the front end components.

            We started our user research by attending two events where people expressed a diversity of opinions:

            <a href="http://cmes.berkeley.edu/mena-salon/">Center for Middle Eastern Studies</a> hosts an informal weekly coffee hour and guided discussion of current events in the Middle East and North Africa.

            After the event, we interviewed a couple people, following this discussion guide:

        <div class="body-paragraph">
            Here were a couple interpretations we made after observing the event and also interviewing participants: <br>
            <div class="sub-body-paragraph">

                - Conversation can be directed by a source of authority <br>
                - Conversation can be smooth and efficient when there is a set of rules people know about and follow <br>
                - Wording is important when talking about a topic. Words that signify statements as subjective opinions allow thoughts to be challenged or even supportive <br>
                - Discussion can be richer when people understand what’s being said and share the same factual knowledge as the ones speaking <br>
                - People are more likely to talk and listen to/with other people that are like-minded  <br>
                - People are more likely to listen if you listen to them, even if their opinion differs from yours  <br>
                - It’s hard to have/find open conversation with people who don’t share the same perspective <br>

        <div class="body-paragraph">
            Here were some takeaways from our interviews: 
            <div class="sub-body-paragraph">
                - Conversations, especially about controversial topics, requires mutual trust and respect for one another in order to be effective <br>
                - Relevant topics are a strong motivator for people to attend talks, even ones with opposing views <br>
                - People groups generally will not tolerate opinions that put down their humanity <br>
                - The viewpoints of these talks should be presented with honesty and tranparency <br>

            We user tested with 5 different people, having them go through the following core user task while talking out loud:
        </div>

        <div class="sub-body-paragraph">
            Participate in a conversation with someone under someone else’s post and gain new knowledge from the exchange. (the replies from other users will be simulated on our end so the user can reply).
        </div>


        <img src="images/case_studies/socratic/usertesting.png" class="casestudy-img">

        <div class="body-paragraph">
            After completing the task, we asked users to give us feedback via <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScrV4NLZvh5nwLeU0pVxYGpF2gtliVgyWgkdwc-qN7fF9igWA/viewform">this google form</a>, and gave them time to fill it out.
        </div>

        <div class="body-paragraph">
            We received a lot of feedback and found many places to improve the product from the tests we conducted:
            <div class="sub-body-paragraph">
                -   Difficult navigation <br>
                -   Core user task and what people found the site was meant for was unclear <br>
                -   "Give us a nickname" prompt when adding a new opinion was confusing <br>
                -   Might be helpful to have a name of the website <br>
                -   Put a username attributed to the opinion otherwise they just think it’s a topic not someone's opinion <br>
                -   People found unclear: What are the comments? What are people trying to do in the comments? What standpoints are they coming from? <br>
                -   How to display an ongoing conversation <br>
                -   The comment section doesn't look like a comment section <br>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="body-paragraph">
            Most of the problems that came up from the prototype simply came from the fact that we didn’t have the time to create a fully fleshed-out app.This was okay since we were mainly interested in testing our concept. The conceptual aspect is where we received the most <span class="bolder">valuable feedback</span>:
            <div class="sub-body-paragraph">
                -   The concept in general seems very boring to users <br>
                -   Most users said they would not want to use this app <br>
                -   Discussion with intent to learn from others isn’t encouraged by the current interface <br>

            ITERATE
        </div>

        <div class="body-paragraph">
            With the feedback we received, we decided to improve our app with the following goals:
            <div class="sub-body-paragraph">
                - Engage users with more directed content in order to focus conversation <br>
                - Encourage discussion on important topics from people of different backgrounds <br>

            We wanted to make the following changes

                <div class="sub-sub-body-paragraph">
                    • We decided to only allow one opinion so that all traffic is funneled to that one discussion for people to participate <br>

                </div>
                - 3 articles related to the event for users to read <br>
                <div class="sub-sub-body-paragraph">
                    • Each article would come from a different part of the political spectrum (inspired by <a href="https://www.allsides.com/unbiased-balanced-news">allsides</a>) <br>
                </div>

                - Buttons to indicate whether or not you agree or disagree with the stated opinion <br>
                - two comment threads that separates those who agree and those who disagree <br>
                <div class="sub-sub-body-paragraph">
                    • Replies would be color-coded to indicate whether or not you agree with the opinion <br>
                    • The comment area would not be visible until you indicated your position <br>
                </div>
                - Comments with the most points rise to the top
                <div class="sub-sub-body-paragraph">
                    • The catch is <span class="bolder">you can only upvote comments made by those who disagree with your perspective</span> <br>
                    • You cannot see the score of comments by those who agree with you
