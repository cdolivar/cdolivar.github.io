        <div class="body-paragraph">
            Berkeley Innovation is UC Berkeley’s Human-Centered Design Consultancy. The following design challenge was given by them as part of their membership application: <br>

            USER RESEARCH
        </div>

        <div class="body-paragraph">
            The scope of the problem was broad so I conducted user research by going to a local grocery store and talked to people while they were shopping in order to figure out their needs and pain points when finding an item. A couple of questions I asked them were: <br>

                There were a couple things I learned after interview a handful of people at Safeway:<br>

                <div class="sub-body-paragraph">
                    - Shoppers had different ways of tracking what they needed (lists, texts, memory) <br>
                    - People will buy things they didn’t intend on buying if they see it and realize they want or need it<br>
                    - People will rely on the signs at the end of each aisle to figure where their items are<br>
                    <div class="sub-sub-body-paragraph">• More experienced/regular shoppers have an idea of where things are so they only use signs when they can’t remember<br>

                        • Most people will go to an employee after not being able to find an item<br>

            <div class="body-paragraph">
                From there, I created a couple Personas using the interviews I conducted in order to frame the design space.

            <div class="body-paragraph">
                After synthesizing personas from my insights, I sat down and brainstormed possible solutions, guiding my ideas by the following “How Might We”: <br>

            <div class="body-paragraph">
                I took a couple of these ideas and decided to create a mobile app that incorporates the following features: <br>
                <div class="sub-body-paragraph">
                    - map/directory of the store <br>
                    - catalog for looking up items <br>
                    - mapping and direction <br>
                    - A grocery list <br>
                </div>

                <br style="margin-bottom:240px;"/>

                This app focuses on the following assumptions gained from interviews: <br>
                <div class="sub-body-paragraph">
                    - People are already used to using aisle signs to look for their items<br>
                    - Frequency of use would allow them to get a better feel for the store <br>
                    - People don’t want to talk to another human when looking for their items <br>

                        • It wasn’t clear if the user had to pick a new store every time they opened the app <br>
