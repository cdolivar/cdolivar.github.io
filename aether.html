            During the process of manufacturing a drug, chemists reach a stage in which they attempt to find the most cost-efficient and highest yielding combination of chemicals to create a specified final molecule. Currently, this testing and iteration takes place over the course of months and involves complex decision-making with minimal technology. With Aether’s use of robotics and data modeling, this timeline can be shorteed, projects or data can be easily managed, and millions of dollars can be saved.

            PROBLEM

        <div class="body-paragraph">
            Our team of four designers was tasked with designing the interface for Aether's web app that will allow <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/careers/college-to-career/chemistry-careers/process-chemistry.html">process chemists</a> to use their services to find enzymes to shorten their process for molecule syntesis.

            USER RESEARCH
        </div>

        <div class="body-paragraph">
            We interviewed process chemists in the pharmaceutical industry in order to get an idea of their everyday workflow and identify possible pain points. Since none of us are chemists, and lacked technical understanding, we were particularly interested in what types of data input and output process chemists expected/wanted from such a service.

        <div class="body-paragraph">
            We did phone interviews with several chemists and took away some notable quotes:<br>

            <div class="sub-body-paragraph">
                - "There is a lot of skepticism in predictive software. Chemists want to see the justification and decision-making process on how the predictions add up." <br>
                - "I usually keep track of data by writing it down in my notebooks" <br>
                - "I would want more information about how enzymes work in biocatalyss because it is not as accessible at the moment"

                - Skeptical of predictive software along with the security of their work <br>
                - Typically only use physical notebooks or Microsoft Suite to keep track of data <br>
                - Primarily identifies molecules visually rather than by their titles
                - Prefer a simple yet technical layout to keep from being too cluttered or confusing <br>

            We also came with a list of data process chemists wanted/expected including:

        <div class="body-paragraph">
            Our team started with creating a general user flow before splitting up individually and brainstorming rough wireframes. Later we came together with our client and discussed our ideas and consolidated what worked, removed what didn't work, and got feedback on what could be added and improved.

        <div class="body-paragraph">
            The overall goal was to allow chemists to easily compare results of various tests, leading us to a tab-based system. During this period we also deliberated on various information hierarchies for data and project management, ranging from folders with tags to a cascading sidebar.

        <div class="body-paragraph">
            We took our sketches and digitally formalized them on Figma. We ultimately decided on a card sorting system with workspaces, screens, and optimizations integrated into each project.

            Moving into our high-fidelity screens, we fleshed out the design for each project, creating a dashboard and activity log with a description and comments section. We also implemented an organization space that allows for common project groupings and team management for administrators of the company.

                    • Aether's CEO would join some of our interviews in order to bridge our lack of technical understanding. He would occassionally follow up on a response or comment, and end up revealing pieces of information we never would have found with our original discussion guide.
